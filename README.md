# mcf-bagelplate - Opinionated Minecraft data pack boilerplate
Opinionated data pack boilerplate. Preinstalled with [Lantern Load](https://github.com/LanternMC/load) and abides by [MCDatapacks](https://mc-datapacks.github.io/en/conventions/datapack_advancement.html) conventions.


## Installation
Download the repo as a zip file and extract to your `datapacks` folder, or, if you have git installed, run `git clone https://github.com/AmericanBagel/mcf-bagelplate` or, if you want a custom folder name (not `mcf-bagelplate`), run `git clone https://github.com/AmericanBagel/mcf-bagelplate <your folder name>`, replacing `<your folder name>` with, well, your folder name.

Then run the prepare script with `python3 prepare.py` in the terminal, answer the questions, and get working on your data pack!

## Purpose
I made this pack for easy boiler plate. When I have a quick data pack idea, I often find myself spending a few minutes setting the whole thing up, getting bored, and abandoning it. I wanted to change that, so I made this.
